      <p>Building a React application with TypeScript and SCSS allows for a powerful combination
        of type safety, modular styling, and component-based development. Leveraging TypeScript's
        static typing helps catch potential errors early in the development process, while SCSS
        provides a convenient way to manage styles in a scalable and maintainable manner. </p>
